[![Sonarcloud Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=com.github.sbaudoin:sonar-ansible&metric=coverage)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=com.github.sbaudoin:sonar-ansible)

A SonarQube plugin to audit and keep under control your Ansible playbooks: apply development standards to your deployment scripts and manage your DevOps technical debt.

## Features
This plugin leverages the [YAML SonarQube plugin](https://github.com/sbaudoin/sonar-yaml/) and adds some additional rules dedicated to Ansible:
* Support for all standard Ansible Lint rules
* Simple extension mechanism to add your own Ansible Lint rules with (very) limited knowledge of Java and Maven

## Installation and execution
### Requirements
* SonarQube 6.6 minimum with the [SonarQube plugin for YAML](https://github.com/sbaudoin/sonar-yaml/) (the exact required version is detailed in the [release page of the Ansible plugin](releases)).
* On the machine that will audit the code:
    * [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/) version 3.4+ must be installed
    * [Sonar scanner](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-cli) configured to point to your Sonar server

Tested on Linux.

### Installation
1. Download the [YAML](https://github.com/sbaudoin/sonar-yaml/releases) and [Ansible SonarQube](https://github.com/sbaudoin/sonar-ansible/releases) plugins
2. Copy them into the `extensions/plugins` directory of SonarQube and restart SonarQube
3. Log in SonarQube
4. Create a new quality profile for YAML and enable the Ansible rules (search with the tag "ansible")
5. Install Ansible Lint and the Sonar scanner on a Linux machine. If needed, you can set the path to the ansible-lint executable
   in the general settings of SonarQube (see below).
   
### Configuration
The plugin supports different parameters that you can set in at the general or project level:
* Path to the `ansible-lint` executable. If not set, `ansible-lint` is expected to be available in the path (which should be the case for standard ansible-lint installations)
* [As of version 2.2.0](https://github.com/sbaudoin/sonar-ansible/releases/tag/v2.2.0), path to an [ansible-lint configuration file](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/configuring/configuring.html#configuration-file). If set,
  a `-c` option is passed to ansible-lint with the indicated configuration file path; if not set, no `-c` option is passed and ansible-lint will look at a `.ansible-lint`
  located in the same directory as the `sonar-project.properties` file.

Paths can be absolute or relative. Paths are relative to the root of the project.

### Execution
1. Prior to executing a code audit, you must create a file `sonar-project.properties` that will contain some details about your project (this is a requirement from the Sonar scanner):

    ```INI
    # must be unique in a given SonarQube instance
    sonar.projectKey=com.mycompany:my-playbook
    # this is the name and version displayed in the SonarQube UI. Was mandatory prior to SonarQube 6.1.
    sonar.projectName=A Name
    sonar.projectVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT
    
    # Path is relative to the sonar-project.properties file. Replace "\" by "/" on Windows.
    # This property is optional if sonar.modules is set.
    sonar.sources=.
    
    # Encoding of the source code. Default is default system encoding
    #sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
    ```

    You just have to do that once. Ideally, add this file along with your playbooks in your preferred SCM.
2. Run the Sonar scanner from the playbook directory:

        sonar-scanner

3. Go to SonarQube and check the result

Subsequent scans will just required the last step to be executed. It can easily be integrated into a continuous integration pipeline.

## Severity levels mapping
As of version 3.5, Ansible Lint defines severities. Here is the mapping with SonarQube's severity levels:

| Ansible Lint Level | SonarQube Level |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| `INFO`             | Info            |
| `VERY_LOW`         | Info            |
| `LOW`              | Minor           |
| `MEDIUM`           | Major           |
| `HIGH`             | Critical        |
| `VERY_HIGH`        | Blocker         |

## Standard and extended rules
The default Ansible Lint rules are available by default (but not activated). So far:

The `Exxx` rules are only available as of version 2.0.0 of this plugin and with `ansible-lint` version 3.5+.
See [the Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-lint/rules/default_rules.html).

As this plugin extends the YAML plugin, you can also enable and configure any other YAML rule.

Besides, you can easily add your own Ansible Lint rules: see the [sonar-ansible-extras-plugin](sonar-ansible-extras-plugin) documentation.

## Known issues
### Plugin version 1.x.x not compatible with `ansible-lint` 3.5+
The version 1 of this plugin is not compatible with `ansible-lint` 3.5+. Please use `ansible-lint` version 3.4 with this first release of the plugin.
Be aware that this may also apply to custom rules packaged into the extras plugin.
