<p>Running <code>ansible-playbook --syntax-check ...</code> failed.</p>

<p>This error <strong>cannot be disabled</strong> due to being a prerequisite for other steps.
    You can either exclude these files from linting or better assure they can be
    loaded by Ansible. This is often achieved by editing inventory file and/or
    <code>ansible.cfg</code> so ansible can load required variables.</p>

<p>If undefined variables are the failure reason you could use jinja <code>default()</code>
    filter in order to provide fallback values.</p>
