<p>Rule violations reported by YamlLint when this is installed.</p>

<p>You can fully disable all of them by adding <code>yaml</code> to the </code>skip_list</code>.</p>

<p>Specific tag identifiers that are printed at the end of rule name,
    like <code>trailing-spaces</code> or <code>indentation</code> can also be skipped, allowing
    you to have a more fine control.</p>

<p>By default this rule is not used when yamllint library is missing. If you want
    to make its absence a runtime failure, please add </code>yaml</code> to </code>enable_list</code>
    inside the configuration file.</p>
